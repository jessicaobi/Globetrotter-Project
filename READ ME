### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I would definitely say that the topics discussed helped me with formulating my website. This is because I was able to formally learn about HTML and CSS and practice it with the labs.
Some of the content that definitely helped was things such as flex box, understanding elements and how they can be customized in CSS. Understanding precedence when it came to order of multiple classes for one element, ids, and tags was also very important for this project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I think I would have allocated less times for the labs and try to spend more time on the project itself. Although I did find the stuff I did with the labs helpful, I noticed a lot more students jumping into the project quicker than me.

If I had more time, I also would have liked the navbar to go from a horizontal version to a drop down when getting under a certain size.

I still feel like the website could be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

I would like to include links on how to visit places in the photo gallery as well.

I would also like to embed a PDF or a link to download the PDF that I referenced for the accommodations.

I think there could also be more work done with flexbox on some pages.



* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

At first I was staying completely away from AI. However, I was informed after the first day that many people were using AI to help them which I definitely feel like set me back a bit if I knew we could freely use it.
This would have helped me more to focus less on the content and writing it myself and just auto-filling it as a place holder so that I can focus more on design.

I think the final product actually turned out very well and I thoroughly enjoy how it looks given the amount of time I was given. I think I was able to utilize almost all if not all of the features that we learned during the lessons.

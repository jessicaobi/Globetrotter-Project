            <p>This is Rwanda's most prominent genocide memorial. When visiting and learning about the sociopolitical landscape of Rwanda, it is impossible to not mention the genocide that occured a little over 30 years ago in 1994. This killed over 1 million people in 100 days. The Memorial highlights the history leading up to the genoice, including how both German and Belgian colonization influenced the viewing of ethnic groups in Rwanda. The suffering of the Tutsi people, how it was ended, perspectives from survivors, and highlighting many of the victims who unfortunately passed away due to the tragedy.</p>

            <p>The Ellen DeGeneres Campus uses tourist support to fund education and resarch that helps keep the animals within the national parks safe. Additionally, the campus teaches people about conservation and trains the next generation of scientists and community workers. The capitalization on tourism makes it possible to fund these programs and encourages people to care more about the environment.</p>
